While this thesis has answered some of open problems that are concerned with spherical latin bitrades, not all such problems have been solved. Some of them are mentioned in Chapter \ref{chap:bounds}, but we didn't formulate the most famous one -- the Barnette's conjecture. In language of latin bitrades, it can be stated as follows:

\begin{conj*}[Barnette]
The graph of a spherical connected latin bitrade has a Hamiltonian cycle.
\end{conj*}%

\noindent
It has been computationally proved that if a counterexample exists, it must have at least 86 vertices. For more about the conjecture we refer the reader to \cite{Hertel05}.
